In these scripts, i've attempted to follow the spirit of the example
exercises of the OpenCL Programming Guide by Aaftab Munshi et al.

These scripts were written as a learning exercise for me, and so
they don't demonstrate a great deal of expertise.  I'm not attempting
brevity, but rather the pythonic wisom that explicit is better than implicit.
I've tried to explore the functionality of the OpenCL programming language and
have enjoyed the ease of use provided by Andreas Kloeckner's PyOpenCL.
